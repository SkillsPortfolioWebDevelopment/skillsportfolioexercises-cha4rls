    <p>1. This TV series is the sort of show that makes you go back to re-live some scenes after you've watched the whole series because it brings back some sweet thoughts or funny crazy things that still make you laugh long after you've seen it. Although it highlights some elements from the Bible, it's fictional but very thought provoking. If anything, it brings you closer to your beliefs as a Christian so Christians should not be put off by the title. My biggest take away from this series is " unconditional love", the love that the two main characters had for one another and the love that existed between all the principal characters. They couldn't have chosen better actors for each role, every actor was perfect for their character. The whole series was highly entertaining, very funny and romantic with minimal nudity and love scenes. Your mind and heart moves with the characters in every episode. Cleverly and brilliantly written, I couldn't recommend it enough.  Although I have completed the whole series, I still go back to some scenes that I can't get out of my mind. My favourite scene of the whole series is Chloe and Lucifer playing the piano in season 1. There was zero physical contact between them but it was the most romantic scene for me. Needless to say that I have seen that scene well, a few times. Well done to the entire team for putting such a memorable show together, I'm so glad I watched it!

        2. Such a delightful gem to find.  The uncanny humor with a touch of the eternal theme is exactly “what I desire” when I relax and turn on Netflix.  The writers tiptoe through the Genesis Bible stories we all grew up with giving plot lines such weight as we all wonder just what those first created human souls could have been like as portrayed by such a talented cast.  

        Tasteful, respectful and charming as this may well be my favorite Netflix show.  May this show have a glorious ending next season but for me, Lucifer is a huge win and worth my year’s membership fee by itself.  I can’t wait to see Chloe, Eve and Lucifer again with the plot twists I’m not expecting.  Great job everyone!! A must watch show from the beginning!!

        3. I absolutely loved watching lucifer its full of relationships, crime solving and mystery. It's amazing how the persona over the devil changes once he gets entangled with the detective. I highly recommend this show to everyone. It's sad it had to come to an end. 

        It keeps you on the edge of your seat as you wonder what lucifer is going to do next, I bingedwatched this every day and night when I had the time to get to the end because I love it it would have to be the best thing on Netflix. It's amazing with all the sex, drugs and alcohol that he doesn't get his true desire til season 5. The detective is an amazing lady balancing work and home life in an equal balance couldn't ask for a more amazing wo.an. Maze is awesome with all thise kickass ninja skills and I love it how she starts off this real badass then as season's go on she becomes open hearted. The relationship  eternal Dan and Lucifer is just hilarious a real hate war between them but eventually they get along.

        5. The show is worth watching from start to end. All the seasons are super interesting and the show gets better with each season, which is rare for long running shows. I personally loved it a lot. It has fantasy, drama, action, romance and humour. The characters are their arcs are amazing and well done too. And the best part is the depth with which the show debates the dillma between fate and choice, between free will and faith. The show also looks at questions of self love. And overall its awesome, would keep you hooked but also give you the feels. Definetly a great show  to watch with your partner. Highly recommended. Also, it would be immature to dismiss the show as blasphemous just because the charecter is "lucifer", because the show delves into the questions of belives and morality with a lot respect. Its a lot less about religion, and a lot more about morality and self improvement, and lucifer's journey to becoming accountable for his mistakes and forgiving himself for things that weren't his fault. Overall the show is beutiful, and touching. Worth every second.

        6. Worth catching at your free time! This show consist of funny moments while also scenes that tugs your deepest heart strings. It’s beautiful to see how each character grows and learn so much about themselves, each other & be a better versions of themselves. I also extremely enjoy how certain narratives of the crimes projected a particular struggle or insecurity of the acts, which made it so relatable for them and helped to express what they were feeling or thinking in that episode. Their dialogues can be thought-provoking and makes you reflect about what you feel, your own journey in life too. 

        Definitely a 5-star for me, and worth re-watching this series again!

        7. From episode 1 of Luficer to the very last moment available to view, this show and its writers provide an incredibly upbeat story that bring you a myriad of relatable emotions and comedy! With a cast of "A" Class actors in well combined roles that challenge them in fun and intricate ways this show is an absolute blast to watch, and I am no where near religious. I also believe with the way the show is written it can absolutely appeal to the more traditionally religious audiences as well. Depending on your claimed devotion.

        A big THANK YOU to the entire staff that helped organize and actualize this incredible show that has come back from the "dead" not 1 but 2 times! What a great project this has been</p>
